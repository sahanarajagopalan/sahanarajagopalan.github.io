# 👋 Hello there! I'm Sahana 
### ✨ About Me
 I'm a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Information Science & Data Science with a Business minor.

 I’m passionate about product management, data science, and fintech, and I love building tools that make technology more intuitive and accessible.

I’ve worked across analytics, product research, and consulting through Illinois Business Consulting and as VP of Illinois Data Science Club, leading projects, workshops, and community initiatives.

 My interests span ML, NLP, financial technology, and user-centric system design — especially products that help people make better decisions.

 Outside of school, I enjoy fashion, coffee shops, travel planning, and building fun side projects.

### 🧠 What I’m Currently Learning
Markets & financial systems — building a stronger foundation in how products, data, and incentives shape real-world markets.

Large Language Models — transformers, embeddings, and how to use LLMs to build practical tools like assistants and recommender systems.

Core data science skills — model tuning, evaluation metrics, feature engineering, and end-to-end ML workflows.

AI product thinking — how to translate user problems into data-driven features and design responsible, useful AI systems.

Data tooling — improving my Python, SQL, and dashboarding skills to build cleaner, more scalable projects.
