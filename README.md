I am currently working on an AI-powered Personal Finance Recommendation System — a smart financial assistant that analyzes a user’s spending behavior and generates personalized budgeting, savings, and investment guidance.
This project combines data science, machine learning, and LLM-powered reasoning to create a personalized financial experience similar to modern fintech tools.
