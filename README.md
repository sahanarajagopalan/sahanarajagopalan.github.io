# 👋 Hello there! I'm Sahana 
### ✨ About Me
💡 I'm a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Information Science & Data Science with a Business minor.

📊 I’m passionate about product management, data science, and fintech, and I love building tools that make technology more intuitive and accessible.

📚 I’ve worked across analytics, product research, and consulting through Illinois Business Consulting and as VP of Illinois Data Science Club, leading projects, workshops, and community initiatives.

🚀 My interests span ML, NLP, financial technology, and user-centric system design — especially products that help people make better decisions.

🎸 Outside of school, I enjoy fashion, coffee shops, travel planning, and building fun side projects.

### 🧠 What I’m Currently Learning
Markets & financial systems — building a stronger foundation in how products, data, and incentives shape real-world markets.

Large Language Models — transformers, embeddings, and how to use LLMs to build practical tools like assistants and recommender systems.

Core data science skills — model tuning, evaluation metrics, feature engineering, and end-to-end ML workflows.

AI product thinking — how to translate user problems into data-driven features and design responsible, useful AI systems.

Data tooling — improving my Python, SQL, and dashboarding skills to build cleaner, more scalable projects.
